# code_meli_validator
this is a simple but useful code that verifies if an iranian national code (a code that is unique to every citizen) is valid . there are apis for this fewer than 20 line code that can charge you money for every call . there are also free apis . but this is a simple and very useful version if anyone needed to apply it .
